Here are the predictions for the 2023 Vuelta a España, in the graph the probability of a breakaway win is the purple coloured column and the green coloured column represents the probability of the contrary, the probability of not a breakaway win.

In first sight, it seems like fewer breakaway wins are predicted in this year’s Vuelta compared with the 2023 Tour de France. 

### Prediction analysis 

In first sight, it seems like fewer breakaway wins are predicted in this year’s Vuelta compared with the 2023 Tour de France. 

The model does not predict a breakaway win until the third stage which finishes in the climb of Anisal in Andorra. As mentioned in the Tour 2023 predictions, this stage is suitable for early breakaways and for any rider who is able to scape from the peloton in the penultimate climb of Coll d’Ordino. All the stage profile photos shown in this page are taken from the [Vuelta a España website](https://www.lavuelta.es/en/).

The following stage is the second with less breakaway win probability, this is due to the flatness of it. A sprint finish between the fastest riders of the peloton is expected.

The stages which are most suitable for a breakaway win are all from the end of the first week. The first of those three stages is the sixth one which ends at the astrophysics observatory in Javalambre. This stage has more than 4000 meters of vertical climbing and has a quite hard beginning which allows a powerful break to form.

The eighth stage finishing in the town of Xorret de Catí which is a classic finishing town where breakaways tend to arrive thanks to the broken profile of the stage.

The next stage finishing in Caravaca de la Cruz is the one that is predicted to be the most suitable for the breakaway, the final climb is not hard enough for the general classification contenders to make differences so is probable that they will let the break take the win.

Stages eleven to twenty have similar probabilities which oscillate between 40% and 60%, that makes the stages highly unpredictable and difficult to predict. One of the most difficult stages to predict is the penultimate one, the predictor does not give the break many chances (only 30%) but knowing that is the last chance for the general classification contenders to change things and that the profile of the stage is highly suitable for long range attacks, the stage will be difficult to predict.

The last stage of the Vuelta is the easiest one to predict as 96% of chances are for a non-breakaway win, in this case this is due to the tradition of the peloton to end the grand tours with a clam stage finishing in a mass sprint.

### Conclusions

The model has performed slightly worse than expected as it predicted correctly 15 out of 19 stages, a **success rate of 79%**. 

The first week of the Vuelta a España was chaotic including two stage finals neutralized, a team trial ridden in the dark and lots of crashes even after the finish of the stage. In this context, the model failed to correctly predict two stages.

The third stage had 56% of chances for a breakaway win but the last member of it, Lennar Kämna, was caught 4 kilometres away from the finish line by the group of favourites. I believe this error is a consequence of the chaotic team trial of the first stage, if a strong would had won it, maybe they would have not tried to keep the leaders jersey in the first week. Anyway, the model predicted an almost fifty-fifty situation, so it was difficult to be right in the prediction. 

This is not the case of the second prediction error, the eight stage which it was given a clear 82% of possibilities for the breakaway. The break was numerous and had some quality climbers like Damiano Caruso, Romain Bardet and many others, but failed to reach the finish line in Xorret de Catí.

The second week of the race featured the only individual time trial of the race and some breakaway wins which were all correctly predicted. It also featured a key stage that resulted a turning point for the rest of the Vuelta: The stage finishing at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet ended Remco Evenepoel’s GC hopes and showed the great superiority of the Jumbo-Visma riders. This would result in Remco trying to get in the break almost every day and making the breakaway probabilities change dramatically for pre-Vuelta predictors. After the Tourmalet day, Evenepoel was in the break in six of the last eight days.

The other two mistakes were made in the last week and in both cases a breakaway arrived the finish line in stages where it was not predicted. The eighteenth stage was predicted to be a fight between the GC contenders, but the break made it to the line due to the strength of Remco Evenepoel and his break companions and due to the lack of challenges to the Jumbo-Visma domination made by other teams.

As I wrote in the prediction analysis, the twentieth stage was hard to predict without knowing how the race was going to be before the stage. A crowded breakaway arrived to the finish line of Guadarrama with a great margin over the peloton where there was no energy left to fight for the stage or to improve the general classification position.
