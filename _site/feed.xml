<h3 id="prediction-analysis">Prediction analysis</h3>

<p>In first sight, it seems like fewer breakaway wins are predicted in this year’s Vuelta compared with the 2023 Tour de France.</p>

<p>The model does not predict a breakaway win until the third stage which finishes in the climb of Anisal in Andorra. As mentioned in the Tour 2023 predictions, this stage is suitable for early breakaways and for any rider who is able to scape from the peloton in the penultimate climb of Coll d’Ordino. All the stage profile photos shown in this page are taken from the <a href="https://www.lavuelta.es/en/">Vuelta a España website</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/vuelta_et3.png" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 3" /></p>

<p>The following stage is the second with less breakaway win probability, this is due to the flatness of it. A sprint finish between the fastest riders of the peloton is expected.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/vuelta_et4.png" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 4" /></p>

<p>The stages which are most suitable for a breakaway win are all from the end of the first week. The first of those three stages is the sixth one which ends at the astrophysics observatory in Javalambre. This stage has more than 4000 meters of vertical climbing and has a quite hard beginning which allows a powerful break to form.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/vuelta_et6.png" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 6" /></p>

<p>The eighth stage finishing in the town of Xorret de Catí which is a classic finishing town where breakaways tend to arrive thanks to the broken profile of the stage.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/vuelta_et8.png" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 8" /></p>

<p>The next stage finishing in Caravaca de la Cruz is the one that is predicted to be the most suitable for the breakaway, the final climb is not hard enough for the general classification contenders to make differences so is probable that they will let the break take the win.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/vuelta_et9.png" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 9" /></p>

<p>Stages eleven to twenty have similar probabilities which oscillate between 40% and 60%, that makes the stages highly unpredictable and difficult to predict. One of the most difficult stages to predict is the penultimate one, the predictor does not give the break many chances (only 30%) but knowing that is the last chance for the general classification contenders to change things and that the profile of the stage is highly suitable for long range attacks, the stage will be difficult to predict.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/vuelta_et20.png" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 20" /></p>

<p>The last stage of the Vuelta is the easiest one to predict as 96% of chances are for a non-breakaway win, in this case this is due to the tradition of the peloton to end the grand tours with a clam stage finishing in a mass sprint.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/vuelta_et21.png" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 21" /></p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>The model has performed slightly worse than expected as it predicted correctly 15 out of 19 stages, a <strong>success rate of 79%</strong>.</p>

<p>The first week of the Vuelta a España was chaotic including two stage finals neutralized, a team trial ridden in the dark and lots of crashes even after the finish of the stage. In this context, the model failed to correctly predict two stages.</p>

<p>The third stage had 56% of chances for a breakaway win but the last member of it, Lennar Kämna, was caught 4 kilometres away from the finish line by the group of favourites. I believe this error is a consequence of the chaotic team trial of the first stage, if a strong would had won it, maybe they would have not tried to keep the leaders jersey in the first week. Anyway, the model predicted an almost fifty-fifty situation, so it was difficult to be right in the prediction.</p>

<p>This is not the case of the second prediction error, the eight stage which it was given a clear 82% of possibilities for the breakaway. The break was numerous and had some quality climbers like Damiano Caruso, Romain Bardet and many others, but failed to reach the finish line in Xorret de Catí.</p>

<p>The second week of the race featured the only individual time trial of the race and some breakaway wins which were all correctly predicted. It also featured a key stage that resulted a turning point for the rest of the Vuelta: The stage finishing at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet ended Remco Evenepoel’s GC hopes and showed the great superiority of the Jumbo-Visma riders. This would result in Remco trying to get in the break almost every day and making the breakaway probabilities change dramatically for pre-Vuelta predictors. After the Tourmalet day, Evenepoel was in the break in six of the last eight days.</p>

<p>The other two mistakes were made in the last week and in both cases a breakaway arrived the finish line in stages where it was not predicted. The eighteenth stage was predicted to be a fight between the GC contenders, but the break made it to the line due to the strength of Remco Evenepoel and his break companions and due to the lack of challenges to the Jumbo-Visma domination made by other teams.</p>

<p>As I wrote in the prediction analysis, the twentieth stage was hard to predict without knowing how the race was going to be before the stage. A crowded breakaway arrived to the finish line of Guadarrama with a great margin over the peloton where there was no energy left to fight for the stage or to improve the general classification position.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[The predictions for the 2023 edition of the Vuelta a España are shown below.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">2023 Tour de France breakaway prediction</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/06/30/Tour-breakaway-prediction.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="2023 Tour de France breakaway prediction" /><published>2023-06-30T16:20:22+02:00</published><updated>2023-06-30T16:20:22+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/06/30/Tour-breakaway-prediction</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/jekyll/update/2023/06/30/Tour-breakaway-prediction.html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are the predictions for the 2023 Tour de France, in the graph the probability of a breakaway win is the purple coloured column and the green coloured column represents the probability of the contrary, the probability of not a breakaway win.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/Prediccion.png" alt="Imagen con el grafico de las predicciones" /></p>

<p>As it can be seen, there are many stages that have high probability of a breakaway win, so stage hunters should target stages like stage 10, stage 12 or stage 14 which are the most probable ones.</p>

<h3 id="prediction-analysis">Prediction analysis</h3>
<p>The prediction does not give many hopes to the breakaway in the first four racing days as the teams aiming for the leader jersey will not allow big breakaway groups. The second stage, however, has a remarkable breakaway probability, this is because of the presence of the climb of Jaizkibel which will be crowned at only 17.5 kilometres away from the finish line. The possibility of a small strong group being formed during the climb at more than 20 kilometres away from the line is not negligible. All the stage profile photos are taken from the <a href="https://www.letour.fr/en/">Tour de France website</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET2.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 2" /></p>

<p>The fourth stage is the one with less breakaway possibilities, this can be explained easily, is the first stage of the Tour that is almost completely flat so all sprinter teams will be aiming for it. The third stage is also suitable for sprinters but is has some hills that give a small chance to the breakaway.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET4.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 4" /></p>

<p>The following two stages are the first ones with predicted breakaway win. Stage number five goes from Pau to Laruns and as in second stage, the reason for such high breakaway win probability is the presence of Col de Marie Blanque summit 19 kilometres away from the finish. The stage has two possibilities for a breakaway stage win:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Early breakaway makes it to the end.</li>
  <li>As in 2020 a small group of favourites breaks from the peloton and manages to stay away from others.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET5.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 5" /></p>

<p>The sixth stage has also two possible scenarios for a successful breakaway</p>
<ul>
  <li>Early breakaway manages to arrive like it did in a similar stage in 2015.</li>
  <li>A strong group of not general classification contender climbers goes away from the peloton in Tourmalet.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET6.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 6" /></p>

<p>Stages seven and eight are a great chance for sprinters to fight for stage wins.</p>

<p>The final stage of the first week carries the riders from Saint-Léonerd-de-Noblat to the climb of Puy de Dôme. A breakaway win is predicted so the model predicts some strong climber in the break who would be able to hold to their advantage with the general classification contenders who will try to distance each other in the last climb.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET9.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 9" /></p>

<p>Two of the three first stages of the second week have the highest breakaway probabilities of the race, both are quite similar: hilly stages that finish with large downhill or flat sections and both have around 3000 meters of climbing. The first kilometres of these stages are suitable form a group of punchy riders.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET12.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 12" /></p>

<p>The last three stages of the second week are made for a general classification fight at the alps but the model considers that the Tour will follow the trend of the 2023 Giro and the high mountain stages are going to be won by breakaways.</p>

<p>Stage 13 finishes in the long climb of Grand Colombier which leaves the only possibility for the break to form way earlier and resist the high pace of the yellow jersey contenders’ teams. That is why this has the lower breakaway win probability of this second weekend stages.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET13.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 13" /></p>

<p>In contrast, the next stage is suitable for long range attacks in the same way the stage featuring Col de Marie Blanque was: the hardest climb of the day is crowned 13 kilometres away from Morzine, the town where the finish is located. Leaving Two possible scenarios for a breakaway win: the early break or the long-range attack from a GC contender.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET14.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 14" /></p>

<p>The last stage of the second week ends with a climb to Saint-Gervais and has eight previous categorised climbs making it a great chance for an early breakaway. Is not probable for GC favourites to try an attack in Col de la Croix Fry or Col des Aravis, so the only chance for a breakaway win is the early break.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET15.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 15" /></p>

<p>For the stages of the last week the model does not give many chances to breakaways. The only stage with predicted breakaway win is the first one, the one ending in Courchevel. As in other stages mentioned earlier, this stage can be won by an early breakaway formed in Col des Saises or Cormet de Roselend and by a GC contender who decides to launch his attack at the beginning of the long final climb to the Col de la Loze.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET17.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 17" /></p>

<p>The rest of the stages of the final week are suitable for sprinters except the twentieth one, which will be the last chance for a change in the yellow jersey classification. Because of this the model does not give many chances to breakaways despite the large number of climbs throughout the stage.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ET20.jpeg" alt="Imagen del perfil de la etapa 20" /></p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>

<p>The model has performed with the expected accuracy as it predicted correctly 17 out of 20 stages, a <strong>success rate of 85%</strong>.</p>

<p>In the first race week the model predicted correctly all nine stages where there were only three stages with predicted breakaway win:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The fifth stage finishing in Laruns was won by Jai Hindley who was part of the break formed in the first part of the stage and managed to maintain the difference despite the attack of Jonas Vingegaard in the last climb of Col de Marie Blanque.</li>
  <li>Col du Tourmalet was decisive in the sixth stage, where Jonas Vingegaard launched an attack more than 20 kilometres away from the finish that allowed Tadej Pocagar and him to join the breakaway. In the end Pogacar managed to drop Vingegaard and secure the second breakaway win of the tour.</li>
  <li>The last breakaway win of the first week arrived in the ninth stage. Michael Woods was the strongest rider of the break which was formed in the first kilometres of the day.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second week of the Tour was predicted to be a very suitable week for the breakaways and so it was, the break of the day managed to stay away from the peloton in stages ten, twelve, thirteen and fifteen. The first error of the model came in the fourteenth stage which was won by Carlos Rodriguez who was not part of the break.</p>

<p>The prediction error can be explained by the strategy Team Jumbo Visma adopted for this stage, one of the hardest of this years Tour: Jumbo Visma’s goal was to make the stage the hardest possible in order to repeat what they did in the hardest stages of last years tour, distance Pogacar as Vingegaard is stronger in long and hard days. This tactic resulted in not letting a break full of climbers like Thibaut Pinot, Guillaume Martin, Mikel Landa, Michael Woods, Julian Alaphilippe, Tobias Halland Johannessen, Giulio Ciccone and many other gain enough time on the peloton to compete for the stage.</p>

<p>In the last week, the only stage which had a breakaway win predicted was won by the Austrian rider Felix Gall who came from the break. The model made two errors predicting not breakaway wins in the next two stages.</p>
<ul>
  <li>From Moûtiers to Bourg-en-Bresse, the eighteenth stage was expected to finish in a bunch sprint by the model but a break with three rouleurs such as Victor Campenaerts, Jonas Abrahamsen and Kasper Asgreen were able to steal the win. In the middle of the stage Pascal Eenkhoorn joined these three and played a key role in keeping the peloton away, being able to maintain the break alive with an advantage over the peloton of less than a minute in most of the last kilometres.</li>
  <li>The next day, after a really hard fight to form the breakaway, a big group including some of the main sprinters escaped from the peloton and made it to the finishing town of Poligny where Matej Mohoric won the stage.</li>
